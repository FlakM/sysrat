## Running on macOS

To run dtrace on macOS you need to disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) by booting into recovery mode and running the following command:

```sh
csrutil disable
# or alternatively:
csrutil enable --without dtrace
```
There is a known [bug](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/735939) in macOS which results in the system hanging and requiring a hard reboot.

## Running on Linux

## Running on macOS

To run dtrace on macOS you need to disable SIP (System Integrity Protection) by booting into recovery mode and running the following command:

```sh
csrutil disable
# or alternatively:
csrutil enable --without dtrace
```
There is a known [bug](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/735939) in macOS which results in the system hanging and requiring a hard reboot.

## TODO


- [ ] remove the dependency on `bpftrace` and use aya-rs instead
- [ ] add counting of the processes (if they are similar) to avoid spamming the output - there can be some kind of label incremented
- [ ] calculate the size of the window rendered to gather the number of maximum processes to display. Maybe we can just show like 200?
- [ ] add details for a parent process based on /proc data
- [ ] add ability to filter by regex
- [ ] add ability to filter by some data on kernel side using maps
- [ ] refactor getting the processes code into seperate module
- [ ] add the description what this project does and what it does not
